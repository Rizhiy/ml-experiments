# Purpose
* Convert a model to a form in which it can be used in C++ code.
* Measure if speed has improved.

# Motivation
While Python is a nice language to develop models frequently it can't be used in production.
One of the main languages used in production is C++,
therefore I wanted to get some experience in converting a model from Python to C++.

# Requirements
Since in this experiment C++ will be used, some additional libraries have to be used.
* For CPU test 'OpenVINO' has to be installed.
